## Development Process

We followed a relatively straightforward development process, where we built something, figured out what we liked about it, figured out what we didn't, and built towards what we wanted. There was a lot of quick iteration, and quite a lot of late night collaboration (due to Eric and Will living 10 feet from each other).

## Roles/Responsibilities

Eric fell naturally into the pseudo project manager role, as he usually does. He made a lot of TODO lists and the like for the project, and became the one who knew what all had to be done by the end. He also implemented a majority of the server, and quite a few pieces of the client.

Will was the web guru of the project, who initiated the design prototyping of our general project architecture. He also implemented the majority of the client, and a decent amount of the server. He was also responsible for debugging most everything, and maintaining code quality in the Javascript. The fact that Will knows a large amount about web technologies proved to be invaluable to Tanvir and Eric, who knew very little about web tech.

Tanvir was the driving motivator of the project, without whom none of this would have ever happened. He provided the vision, the data, the poster and much of the paper, and the opportunity to work on something with real world impact. Tanvir inspired the project, and drove it to its fruition.
