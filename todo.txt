* Watts (instead of numbers) on Y axis
* mouseover text for icons saying what they are (name)
+ make different icon for outlets, just make up something, but not just outlet picture
+ total power today readout on top of screen
+ rework icon layout/size/position
+ have icons have on light (little green light) when power over 0
*/+ when click on icon, show total amount of power used so far, and dollars. (Eric will calculate the data needed, Will will build infrastructure to show it).


+ combine total power into one graph
* universal scale for Y axis
* get rid of undefined on graph tooltip (Why is this happening?)
